------------------------- SW Reference ------------------------

* SW goals
 - Use all HW resources to the limit
 - Elegant object oriented code approach
 - Nice and fun game that can actually be played (not just a useless demo)
 - Learn a lot from all this (specially how to make smart and fast code for crap HW)

* Documentation (at least some reference we need)
 - Docs are separeted by the category so that this folder doesn't become a mess
