------------------------- SW Reference ------------------------

* SW goals
 - Use all HW resources to the limit
 - Elegant object oriented code approach
 - Nice and fun game that can actually be played (not just a useless demo)
 - Learn a lot from all this (specially how to make smart and fast code for crap HW)

* Documentation (at least some reference we need)
 - Docs are separeted by the category so that this folder doesn't become a mess

IMPORTANT:
 - Since the Arduino board is selected is "non-conventional" some steps are needed
 - The driver for the serial USB interface CH340 might be needed
 - It can be found in this repo: https://github.com/juliagoda/CH341SER
 - On Linux dialout permission might be needed:
                stat /dev/ttyUSB0
                sudo usermod -a -G dialout USER_NAME
                ls -l /dev/ttyUSB0
