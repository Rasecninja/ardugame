=======================  == == ArduGame == == =========================

* What is this repo?
This is my little pet project that I called ArduGame, a bootleg version of Arduboy

* What is this ArduGame project?
This project is a ground up creation of a small 8 bit handheld game console using Arduino 

* What is the scope of this project?
In this project I: 
   - planed and assembled the hardware
   - coded the game engine and little nasty things necessary to make my life easy
   - made some cool pixel art
   - made a game out of all this
   - prepared documentation 

* Why do I care about your little pet project?
This project can help anyone seeking light in how to make an entire game by oneself, from HW to SW to happiness!

Make sure to always have fun making stuff!!!!

* Improvements
- Clean and finish documentation
- Add a 3D printed case design
- Make a smooth pixel wise movement (not only 8 pixels)
- Search for good sources of pixel art development
